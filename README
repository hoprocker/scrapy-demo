A simple demonstration of scrapy and Flask. Downloads some data from realtor.com, stores it, makes it available on a simple flask website. Runs in its own virtualenv, but *does* overwrite system variables (a fine candidate for a Docker container!).

Very generic right now, just stores every listing as a hash in a Redis database and pulls it every time.

Test with:
* AWS stock Ubuntu 13:10 image, 64-bit

To deploy:
* edit the variables at the top of "deploy.sh"
* make sure that you can 'sudo' w/ the user on the remote machine
* run "./deploy.sh"
