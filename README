A simple demonstration of scrapy and Flask. Downloads some data from realtor.com, stores it, makes it available on a simple flask website. *DOES* overwrite system variables, so use virtualization (a fine candidate for a Docker container!)!

Very generic right now, just stores every listing as a hash in a Redis database and pulls it every time.

NOTE this kills whatever is running on port 9097!!!

Tested with:
* AWS stock Ubuntu 13:10 image, 64-bit

To deploy:
* pull down the code locally
* edit the variables at the top of "deploy.sh"
* make sure that you can 'sudo' w/ the user on the remote machine
* run "./deploy.sh"

NOTE this application makes *global* changes! Run virtualized!
